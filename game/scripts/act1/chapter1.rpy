    # Lucienne narrates the opening
    lucienne "My unusual story begins with an ordinary person's ordinary life..."

    lucienne "...in a small cottage nestled between quiet hills and whispering trees."

    "The air here always smelled of bread and morning dew. Birds chirped like it was their job to cheer me up."

    lucienne "I wasn't born into greatness. No magic. No noble blood. Just a quiet life with the family that took me in."

    scene bg lucienne_home_fireplace with dissolve

    "Warm fire. Worn wooden floorboards. Shelves stacked with books no one ever had time to read."

    "My foster parents were kind, loving. They never asked where I came from. They just… welcomed me."

    lucienne "But deep inside, I always knew something was strange about me. Something I couldn't explain."

    scene bg lucienne_home_window with Dissolve(1.0)

    "My past memories were broken, like a dream I can't piece together."

    "I felt like I knew nothing about myself."

    "I wanted to change that. I wanted the truth."

    lucienne "But nothing could have prepared me for what's to come..."

    "The iron gates of {b}Magia Academia{/b} tower before me — noble, ancient, proud."

    "Beyond them, the spires of the school reach toward the clouds like fingers of ambition."

    lucienne "I still remember the moment my father knocks on my door, holding a letter with trembling hands."

    "It's thick, sealed in crimson wax, and addressed only with my name. No return mark. No crest."

    lucienne "Inside, just one sentence."

    lucienne "And it's signed... by the Headmaster himself."

    "No explanation. No test. No request for payment. Just an invitation to the most prestigious academy in the kingdom."

    "I don't understand it."

    "But standing here now... maybe, just maybe, I'm ready to find out why."

    "Or so I think."

    "A sharp voice cuts through my thoughts."

    unknown "Hey. You're standing in the way."

    lucienne "Huh—?"

    "I step aside quickly, startled. A noble girl sweeps past, her embroidered cloak brushing against me like I'm not even there."

    "Behind her, others follow — some walking alone, others with maids or butlers carrying ornate trunks."

    "Their clothes shimmer with silks and enchanted threads. Their jewelry glitters in the morning light."

    "They hold their heads high, like they own the world."

    "Some glance at me. Not with interest, just... that look. Like they know I don't belong."

    "But none of them stop. None of them speak."

    lucienne "So this is what I'm up against..."

    "I take a deep breath and step through the gates."

    "The courtyard is grand — marble fountains, floating lights, and pillars etched with ancient spells."

    "I follow the stream of students toward the main hall, where the opening ceremony is about to begin."

    "Whatever this place has in store for me... I've already taken the first step."

    "The Grand Auditorium of Magia Academia is exactly as I imagined — vast, fancy, humming with power."

    "Golden chandeliers float above, suspended in air. Rows upon rows of red velvet seats stretch in every direction."

    "Students begin filing in, buzzing with anticipation. Their laughter echoes through the hall."

    "I search for a place to sit... but each time I try, a noble student glares or gestures me away."

    unknown "These seats are reserved."

    unknown "Tch. Commoners have no shame."

    "I feel the heat of stares, the weight of silence pressing me back."

    "Until—"

    "I spot a girl sitting alone, quiet, almost invisible, near the edge of a row. Her silver hair falls over her face as she hugs her bag."

    "She doesn't look up when I approach. She doesn't move when I sit beside her."

    lucienne "...Hi."

    "Just one word, soft and shaky."

    "The girl blinks but says nothing. Just gives the tiniest nod."

    "It's enough."

    "Moments later, the lights dim and a hush falls over the crowd."

    "A tall man with long silver hair steps onto the stage, his robes sweeping behind him like mist."

    "The room holds its breath."

    headmaster "Welcome, students — new and returning—to Magia Academia."

    headmaster "For centuries, this institution has been the heart of magical education, a crucible where talent is tested and greatness forged."

    headmaster "Here, you will learn the elements, the forms, the mysteries of the world — and of yourselves."

    headmaster "You have been chosen not only for your bloodlines or scores, but for what lies within you."

    "Some of the nobles exchange smug glances. I stare straight ahead."

    headmaster "Now, I would like to invite our student representative — the one who achieved the highest entry evaluation — to say a few words."

    "Silence."

    "No one moves."

    "A few heads turn, looking around."

    headmaster "...Well then."

    "His voice remains calm, but there's a trace of amusement in his eyes."

    headmaster "It seems our representative is... otherwise occupied."

    headmaster "Very well. Students, your dorm assignments await. You may exit through the main doors."

    headmaster "As you leave, you will each receive a {b}Magical Companion Notebook{/b}. It will assist you throughout your life here at the Academy."

    headmaster "It contains your schedule, personal grades, announcements, maps, and... reminders."

    headmaster "Treat it well. It remembers everything."

    lucienne "Well... that was something."

    "Still no reply. But as she stands, she gives me the tiniest smile."

    "I take it as a good sign."
